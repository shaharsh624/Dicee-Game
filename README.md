# The Game of Dice

The "Game of Dice" is a multiplayer game where N players roll a 6 faced dice in a round-robin
fashion. Each time a player rolls the dice their points increase by the number (1 to 6) achieved
by the roll.

As soon as a player accumulates M points they complete the game and are assigned a rank.
Remaining players continue to play the game till they accumulate at least M points. The game
ends when all players have accumulated at least M points.

## Rules of the game
- The order in which the users roll the dice is decided randomly at the start of the game.
- If a player rolls the value "6" then they immediately get another chance to roll again and move ahead in the game.
- If a player rolls the value "1" two consecutive times then they are forced to skip their next turn as a penalty.
